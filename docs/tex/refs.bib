	abstract = {The current research aims at deriving a one-dimensional numerical model for describing highly transient mixed flows. In particular, this paper focuses on the development and assessment of a unified numerical scheme adapted to describe free-surface flow, pressurized flow and mixed flow (characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of free-surface and pressurized flows). The methodology includes three steps. First, the authors derived a unified mathematical model based on the Preissmann slot model. Second, a first-order explicit finite volume Godunov-type scheme is used to solve the set of equations. Third, the numerical model is assessed by comparison with analytical, experimental and numerical results. The key results of the paper are the development of an original negative Preissmann slot for simulating sub-atmospheric pressurized flow and the derivation of an exact Riemann solver for the Saint-Venant equations coupled with the Preissmann slot.}

Special attention is given to the Godunov-type schemes that result from using an approximate solution of the Riemann problem. For schemes based on flux splitting, the approximate Riemann solution can be interpreted as a solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. }

	pages={1065-1082},
	abstract={The HLLC (Harten--Lax--van Leer contact) approximate Riemann solver for computing solutions to hyperbolic systems by means of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods is reviewed. HLLC was designed, as early as 1992, as an improvement to the classical HLL (Harten--Lax--van Leer) Riemann solver of Harten, Lax, and van Leer to solve systems with three or more characteristic fields, in order to avoid the excessive numerical dissipation of HLL for intermediate characteristic fields. Such numerical dissipation is particularly evident for slowly moving intermediate linear waves and for long evolution times. High-order accurate numerical methods can, to some extent, compensate for this shortcoming of HLL, but it is a costly remedy and for stationary or nearly stationary intermediate waves such compensation is very difficult to achieve in practice. It is therefore best to resolve the problem radically, at the first-order level, by choosing an appropriate numerical flux. The present paper is a review of the HLLC scheme, starting from some historical notes, going on to a description of the algorithm as applied to some typical hyperbolic systems, and ending with an overview of some of the most significant developments and applications in the last 25 years.},
